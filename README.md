## Setup

Leave the `GUILD_ID` in `.env` file blank if you want to register slash commands globally.

<br />

Add new secret: `TOKEN`, `MONGO_DB`, `CLIENT_ID` and `GUILD_ID` into the environment variables tab (lock icon in sidebar) if you are using [replit](https://replit.com/).

If you are using [replit](https://replit.com/) you can remove `require('dotenv').config()` from `index.js` and you don't need to install `dotenv`
